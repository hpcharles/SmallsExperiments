# SmallsExperiments

This repository provide small codes which helps to experiment with compilers

## SizeOfType

* SizeOfTypes.c will print the differrent size of basic C data type

## VectorAdd

Basic question, is there a difference between vector addition, if the
vector is statically defined or dynamically defined ? 

* VectorAdd.c is a vector addition with 2 implementations :
  * Static : loop and vector are statically defined
  * Dynamic : loop and vector are dyanmically defined (via the command line)
